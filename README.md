# Niklaus-plagiarism

## Purpose

The purpose of the Niklaus project is to provide a tool that can detect plagiarism in programming assignments. It is designed to help educators identify cases of academic dishonesty and ensure that students are submitting original work.

## How it works

Niklaus uses a combination of static analysis and machine learning techniques to compare code submissions and identify similarities. When a new assignment is submitted, Niklaus extracts features from the code, such as variable names, function names, and control structures. 

## Features

- Automated plagiarism detection: Niklaus can automatically compare code submissions to flag potential instances of plagiarism.
- Customizable settings: Educators can configure Niklaus to adjust the sensitivity of the plagiarism detection algorithm and set thresholds for similarity scores.
- Detailed reports: Niklaus generates detailed reports that highlight similarities between code submissions and provide evidence to support academic integrity investigations.

## Getting started

- Compress the selected source code into a single zip file.
- Upload the zip file to Niklaus.
- Niklaus will compare the various code submissions and generate a report highlighting potential instances of plagiarism.
